#### Progress and Issues
This week I wasn't able to accomplish all my goals, as I was very busy in my other classes, but I was still able to make a lot fo progress. The games page is almost complete, I just require some final implementation details to get it working. Profile images should now also be in the repo, so I can now start implementing that into the players page. This will be my next main priority. I am currently not being blocked on anything, and will continue to make progress where applicable
