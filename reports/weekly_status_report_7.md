# Weekly Status Report 7

## Team Report
### Goals From Last Week
- Peer review another project (everyone)
- Add support for player profile pictures in the frontend (Aaron & Amanda)
- Add suggested players from teams feature to the Create Team page (Amanda)
- Continue working on adding live game data to the Games page (Aaron)

### Progress and Issues
We fixed a few bugs on the front end and back end this week. We added sorting by playing time to the quick add team endpoint. We also added a limit to the salary cap customization feature to limit user input and added buttons to remove individual players from the current team. We also revised our documentation and added the user and developer manuals as markdown files in our repository. We learned to use the GitHub Issues feature to track bugs for our project. We are not stuck on anything at the moment.

### Plans and Goals
- Address peer review feedback (everyone)
- Final release! (everyone)

## Team Member Contributions
### 1. Aaron
#### Goals From Last Week
- Finish the games page
- add player profile images and other stats to the players page.

#### Progress and Issues
This week I wasn't able to accomplish all my goals, as I was very busy in my other classes, but I was still able to make a lot fo progress. The games page is almost complete, I just require some final implementation details to get it working. Profile images should now also be in the repo, so I can now start implementing that into the players page. This will be my next main priority. I am currently not being blocked on anything, and will continue to make progress where applicable

#### Plans and Goals
- Continue to progress on player images on players page

### 2. Amanda
#### Goals From Last Week
- Continue working on suggested players for teams to quick add feature.
- Add images for players and the slideshow on the Create Team and Home page.
- Look into potentially using machine learning for backend.

#### Progress and Issues
This week I continued working on the suggested players for teams features for quick add. I also added the functionality to remove players individually from the current team and fixed an issue for the salary cap editor by adding a limit to the input value. I have added the images to the Create Team page and will continue to work on adding the images for the Home page slideshow. In addition, I helped with fixing revisions from last week's feedback. I learned how to use another image when the original image link is broken. I had trouble removing a single player from the team by having each remove button associated with one player. I figured out how to add the function by adding a player's name as the id of each button. I am currently not stuck on anything and will continue working on finishing up the frontend features for our final release.

#### Plans and Goals
- Finish implementing frontend functionality features for our final release.
- Help with the final release and video.

### 3. Caroline
#### Goals From Last Week
- Help the team complete HW8.
- Help frontend where they need and adjust backend to meet their needs.

#### Progress and Issues
This week I peer reviewed another project and improved our documentation following the suggestions from last week. I also added sorting to the quickadd backend endpoint, so it now returns the top 12 minutes played players, rather than just any 12 players on the same team. Again, no issues this week.

#### Plans and Goals
- Help the team with the final release.
- User test our application to make sure all errors are handled and bugs are fixed.


### 4. Juan
#### Goals From Last Week
- Continue to respond to frontend needs for endpoints
- update database as required

#### Progress and Issues
This week I worked on peer reviewing other projects at the same time as working on updating the database with the images for the players and teams. I have been working on cleaning the data and making sure the information is accurate based on the current season. For me to be able to work on the images I had to clean the data using a python script to retrieve and map the data for our tables. 

#### Plans and Goals
- Help the team with the final release
- Help with the documentation and video for next assignment
- Clean and update accurate information for the team

### 5. Ned
#### Goals From Last Week
My goal is to continue to update the algorithm and make it more accurate as we change how some of the team lineups work.

#### Progress and Issues
I updated the algo to better fit the actual standings. I helped facilitate some of the tasks that we still needed to do. I gathered images
to use for our slideshow and have started to look ahead on to next weeks assignment.


#### Plans and Goals
- Write a script for the video
- Edit video
- Help with documentation
