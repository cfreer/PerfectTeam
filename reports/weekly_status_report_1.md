# Weekly Status Report 1

## Team Report
### Goals From Last Week
N/A for the first report.

### Progress and Issues
We mainly focused on finishing HW2 this week and creating a schedule for how we plan on completing this project. We learned how to work together around our busy schedules. We found that it works better to meet up in person or over Zoom rather than trying to message each other about our work. We had trouble creating the use cases for HW2 because we were confused about the format and had overlapping cases. We solved this problem by asking our project manager to clarify the sections and by discussing all of our completed use cases together. One issue we are running into is deciding what language to use for the backend and how to connect it to the React being used for the frontend. We are also still discussing how we will host our final website.

### Plans and Goals
- Create mock UI for website (Aaron, Amanda)
- Write the specification for backend (Caroline, Juan, Ned)

N/A for the first report.

#### Progress and Issues
I helped work on HW2 by writing the fourth use case, some of the toolset, and describing some of the major features and stretch goals. I also worked on proofreading and formatting each section of the document to make sure it was clear and professional. Meeting and messaging with my group worked well for me because I could discuss confusing parts with other team members and determine which parts of the assignment were still incomplete. From working on HW2, I learned how to formulate use cases and establish requirements for a project. One thing I am currently unsure about is how we will host the final web application and database. I initially thought about using GitHub pages with a firebase backend because I have successfully used this combination for a past project. However, I am still researching other options like Heroku.

#### Plans and Goals
- Research more about how we will host our web application
- Create a mock UI for the web application using Figma

### 3. Caroline
#### Goals From Last Week
N/A for the first report.

#### Progress and Issues
Last week I helped complete HW2 by writing my use case, most of the external requirements, and some of the toolset. I also helped clean up the document and worked with the team over Zoom to finalize our report and turn it in. What worked well for me was reaching out to my team when I wasn't sure about expectations and discussing which parts of the assignment still needed help being completed. One thing blocking me right now is not exactly knowing my role in the project, so I don't know where to start.

#### Plans and Goals
- Help team complete the GitHub README.md.
- Figure out what we are using for our backend server and get a basic stucture set up.
