# Weekly Status Report 1

## Team Report
### Goals From Last Week
N/A for the first report.

### Progress and Issues
We mostly focused on finishing HW2 this week and getting a schedule in place for how we plan on completing this project.  We learned how to work together around our busy schedules and that it works better to meet up in person or over Zoom, rather than trying to just message about our work. One issue we are running into is deciding what language to use for the backend and how to connect it to the React being used for the frontend and also how we are going to host our final website.

#### Progress and Issues
Last week I helped complete HW2 by writing my use case, most of the external requirements, and some of the toolset. I also helped clean up the document and worked with the team over Zoom to finalize our report and turn it in. What worked well for me was reaching out to my team when I wasn't sure about expectations and discussing which parts of the assignment still needed help being completed. One thing blocking me right now is not exactly knowing my role in the project, so I don't know where to start.

#### Plans and Goals
- Help team complete the GitHub README.md.
- Figure out what we are using for our backend server and get a basic stucture set up.
