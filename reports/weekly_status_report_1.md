# Weekly Status Report 1

## Team Report
### Goals From Last Week
N/A for the first report.

### Progress and Issues
We mainly focused on finishing HW2 this week and creating a schedule for how we plan on completing this project. We learned how to work together around our busy schedules. We found that it works better to meet up in person or over Zoom rather than trying to message each other about our work. We had trouble creating the use cases for HW2 because we were confused about the format and had overlapping cases. We solved this problem by asking our project manager to clarify the sections and by discussing all of our completed use cases together. One issue we are running into is deciding what language to use for the backend and how to connect it to the React being used for the frontend. We are also still discussing how we will host our final website.

### Plans and Goals
- Create mock UI for website (Aaron, Amanda)
- Write the specification for backend (Caroline, Juan, Ned)

### 1. Aaron
#### Goals From Last Week
N/A for the first report.

#### Progress and Issues
I aided in the completion of HW2 for the majority of this week. I worked on teh first user case, aided in creating the roadmap for the rest fo the quarter, and helped clarify our major risks, and when we would need external advice/testing. As a group we met multiple times during the week, and were able to share a lot of ideas about how we plan on moving forward. We were also able to catch eachothers mistakes, and I was able to recieve a lot of benficial advice from my peers. I learned a lot this week about the importance of planning ahead, and how much less daunting a project can feel when you have walked through use cases and have a clear goal for future endeavours. The main issue I was running into was considering in which way we would be connecting the backend to the frontend, and which languages would be the most comaptible for using alongside React JS. Ardi, our project manager, helped to clear up a lot fo my confusion, but I am going to need to perform some research in the coming future to be certain I can complete my required tasks.

#### Plans and Goals
- Begin our initial mockup of our UI for frontend.
- Figure out what command line calls will be needed for combing different langauges together

### 2. Amanda
#### Goals From Last Week
N/A for the first report.

#### Progress and Issues
I helped work on HW2 by writing the fourth use case, some of the toolset, and describing some of the major features and stretch goals. I also worked on proofreading and formatting each section of the document to make sure it was clear and professional. Meeting and messaging with my group worked well for me because I could discuss confusing parts with other team members and determine which parts of the assignment were still incomplete. From working on HW2, I learned how to formulate use cases and establish requirements for a project. One thing I am currently unsure about is how we will host the final web application and database. I initially thought about using GitHub pages with a firebase backend because I have successfully used this combination for a past project. However, I am still researching other options like Heroku.

#### Plans and Goals
- Research more about how we will host our web application
- Create a mock UI for the web application using Figma

### 3. Caroline
#### Goals From Last Week
N/A for the first report.

#### Progress and Issues
Last week I helped complete HW2 by writing my use case, most of the external requirements, and some of the toolset. I also helped clean up the document and worked with the team over Zoom to finalize our report and turn it in. What worked well for me was reaching out to my team when I wasn't sure about expectations and discussing which parts of the assignment still needed help being completed. One thing blocking me right now is not exactly knowing my role in the project, so I don't know where to start.

#### Plans and Goals
- Help team complete the GitHub README.md.
- Figure out what we are using for our backend server and get a basic stucture set up.

### 5. Ned
#### Goals From Last Week
N/A for the first report.

#### Progress and Issues
This past week I helped complete HW 2 and did some research for how our algorithm will work. On hw2 I worked over zoom with the team on every possible occasion and wrote out the use cases and risks of our project. I also helped comb over the assignment to make sure everything was up to our standard. I also wrote the product description. What worked for us as a team was meeting frequently and looking at each other work. I learned that working together in person or over zoom get work done the fastest and it allows us to hold each other accountable and we work more efficienty with less distractions. We had trouble with be specific in our use cases and clarifying what they wanted out of us for hw 2. What really helped with that was talking with Ardi and keeping him in the loop while we were working. We are stuck on knowing where to start on our project since many of us don't have alot of experience with a project like this.

#### Plans and Goals
Plan is to do some more research and to start working on the spec for the backend. 
A goal would be to come up with a basic algorithm that is somewhat effective in predicting win/loss and also to have a spec done within a week or two.
