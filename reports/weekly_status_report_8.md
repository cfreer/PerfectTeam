- Address peer review feedback (everyone)
- Final release! (everyone)

### Success of the Project
Overall, I think this project was successful due to our teamwork and improved communication skills. Our plan ended up changing multiple times while making progress on the project, but we learned to communicate these changes well to the team, so everyone was on the same page. Additionally, everyone was very supportive of one another by offering help when needed and reviewing each others' code.

### Success of the Project
I believe I helped make this project successful by being available almost all of the time to answer others' questions or review their code and approve their pull requests. I also contributed by being very organized and making the weekly status report almost every week and sending out reminders for due dates. On the technical side, I believe the backend team worked very well together, and I was able to help lead to the project's success by creating almost all of the endpoints for the backend.
