Additionally, everyone was very supportive of one another by offering help when needed and reviewing each others' code.

- Continue to progress on player images on players page

#### Success of the Project
I believe that I was effective in completing my desired goals and adding to stretch goals when applicable. I worked consistently with group members to conceptualize the best plans for proceeding. I aided in the overall completiong of the frontend with all major features accounted for, as well as supplementing those with additional features to improve the overall quality fo our UI. I also focused on API implementations into the frontend, which was one of my primary focuses at the end of the project cycle.

#### Open Issues/Notes
There are no current issues that I am aware of. Functionality is as expected

### 2. Amanda

- Finish implementing frontend functionality features for our final release.
- Help with the final release and video.

#### Success of the Project
I believe I contributed to the success of our project by being available and responsive throughout the day to help with any issues and reviewing pull requests. Also, I helped with finalizing the assignments weekly to make sure we completed them as thoroughly as possible, addressing feedback from previous assignments, reminding others of deadlines, checking in on others' progress, and offering help. In addition, I worked well with both the frontend and backend teams to make sure the frontend and backend were integrated properly. I went above and beyond to design and implement almost all of the major features of our project. I also helped add extra features mentioned in our use cases and ensured all of our features in our final project functioned properly.

#### Open Issues/Notes
None! One issue was opened to suggest adding a limit on the salary cap editor input. I was able to address the suggestion and limit the input value immediately.

#### Success of the Project
I believe I helped make this project successful by being available almost all of the time to answer others' questions or review their code and approve their pull requests. I also contributed by being very organized and making the weekly status report almost every week and sending out reminders for due dates. On the technical side, I believe the backend team worked very well together, and I was able to help lead to the project's success by creating almost all of the endpoints for the backend.
