### 2. Amanda
#### Goals From Last Week
- Add interactions to the Figma prototype.
- Continue implementing static mock-up of pages in React for our web application.
- Create a new logo for PerfectTeam.

#### Progress and Issues
I worked on adding a new workflow to GitHub Actions that builds and tests the frontend of our web application. Also, I set up more React libraries in our project and finished implementing the NavBar component, App, and Home pages in React. I added Jest unit tests for the NavBar and App components, and I am currently working on tests for the Home page. Additionally, I created a new logo for PerfectTeam. Meeting in person to discuss the project worked well for me. This week I learned how to set up GitHub Actions and add our own workflows to automate. I had trouble adding the React libraries to our project, but I fixed the errors by creating a new React project and reinstalling everything. Currently, I am not really stuck on anything and will continue to work on implementing all components and pages of the web application for our beta release next week.

#### Plans and Goals
- Add interactions to the Figma prototype.
- Finish implementing pages in React for our web application.
- Help integrate frontend and backend.

### 3. Caroline
#### Goals From Last Week
- Set up testing and write tests for Team and Player.
- Help the team complete HW5.

#### Progress and Issues
This week I got our CI of choice, GitHub Actions, set up. I also added JUnit tests for the Team class, but I realized I do not yet have a need for testing for the Player class, as it does not have any functionality except for getting and setting fields. One thing I am worried about is getting everything together for our beta release next week.

#### Plans and Goals
- Help the team complete HW6.
- Get the quick add feature for teams working.

### 4. Juan
#### Goals From Last Week
- Finishing the parsing the data from CSV to JSON file and create the endpoints for our project.
- Finishing the structure of our JSON files that will be send to the frontend.

### 5. Ned
#### Goals From Last Week
My plan is to distribute the playing time minutes dependant on how much time they get on their current teams and scale the minutes to fit the 240 minutes that each team plays. I also need to find another source of stats that contain the missing variables that I need for the formula. Another plan I have is to work with Juan on helping him filter the data. My goal for this coming week is to have the algorithm done.
