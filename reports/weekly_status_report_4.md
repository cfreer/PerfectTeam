### 5. Ned
#### Goals From Last Week
My plan is to distribute the playing time minutes dependant on how much time they get on their current teams and scale the minutes to fit the 240 minutes that each team plays. I also need to find another source of stats that contain the missing variables that I need for the formula. Another plan I have is to work with Juan on helping him filter the data. My goal for this coming week is to have the algorithm done.
