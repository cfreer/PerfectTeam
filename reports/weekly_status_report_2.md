# Weekly Status Report 2

## Team Report
### Goals From Last Week
- Create mock UI for website (Aaron, Amanda)
- Write the specification for backend (Caroline, Juan, Ned)

### Progress and Issues
This week Amanda and Aaron came up with mockup for the frontend UI, Amanda and Juan got the Firebase server working, and Juan, Ned, and Caroline got started on implementing the backend. We also worked as a team to get our GitHub set up and organized for HW3. One thing blocking our team this week was lack of communication, as we only had 2/5 members present at our team meeting, so we plan on having full attendance next week and therefore be more organized.

### Plans and Goals
- Start implementing the frontend (Aaron, Amanda)
- Write the specification for backend (Juan, Ned)
- Implement Player and Team class (Caroline)

## Team Member Contributions
### 1. Aaron
#### Goals From Last Week
- Begin our initial mockup of our UI for frontend.
- Figure out what command line calls will be needed for combing different langauges together.

#### Progress and Issues
 I focused mainly on finishing our design on Figma for the UI design. I worked on finalizing a page on games currently occuring
 and a page that presents the user with all of the current teams in the NBA. What worked well for me was having an open line of communication with
 the team members on backend where we were able to discuss what data would be used and presented. I learned a lot this week about the benefits of
 having a plan that is well thought out and well communicated, as it has helped us to avoid a lot of roadblocks that I feel could have occured otherwise.
 The main issue I was running into was in what way data should be expressed in the UI, whether a scroll bar would be more effective in circumstances
 was one example of this. However, many of these issues were quickly solved thanks to communciation with the team.

#### Plans and Goals
- Begin harcoding the frontend in ReactJS
- Work alongside backedend to implement changes in design as seen fit

### 2. Amanda
#### Goals From Last Week
- Research more about how we will host our web application.
- Create a mock UI for the web application using Figma.

### 3. Caroline
#### Goals From Last Week
- Help team complete the GitHub README.md.
- Figure out what we are using for our backend server and get a basic stucture set up.

#### Progress and Issues
This week I started implementing the backend classes for our web application, focusing on the Team and Player classes. I also helped the team complete HW3. One thing blocking me right now is still not having a clear spec of the expected behavior for these classes, but I will hopefully get some clarification on that this week and get a first draft of these classes finished up.

#### Plans and Goals
- Finish Team and Player backend classes.
- Help the team complete HW4.


### 4. Juan
#### Goals From Last Week
- Create the server and system design of the backend by researching different tools and understanding how the data is going to flow.
- Research about the machine learning and algorithms that we can use to get the score for the win/loss projections.

### 5. Ned
#### Goals From Last Week
Plan is to do some more research and to start working on the spec for the backend.
A goal would be to come up with a basic algorithm that is somewhat effective in predicting win/loss and also to have a spec done within a week or two.
