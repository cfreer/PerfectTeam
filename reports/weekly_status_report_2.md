## Team Member Contributions
### 1. Aaron
#### Goals From Last Week
- Begin our initial mockup of our UI for frontend.
- Figure out what command line calls will be needed for combing different langauges together.

#### Progress and Issues
 I focused mainly on finishing our design on Figma for the UI design. I worked on finalizing a page on games currently occuring
 and a page that presents the user with all of the current teams in the NBA. What worked well for me was having an open line of communication with
 the team members on backend where we were able to discuss what data would be used and presented. I learned a lot this week about the benefits of
 having a plan that is well thought out and well communicated, as it has helped us to avoid a lot of roadblocks that I feel could have occured otherwise.
 The main issue I was running into was in what way data should be expressed in the UI, whether a scroll bar would be more effective in circumstances
 was one example of this. However, many of these issues were quickly solved thanks to communciation with the team.

#### Plans and Goals
- Begin harcoding the frontend in ReactJS
- Work alongside backedend to implement changes in design as seen fit

### 5. Ned
#### Goals From Last Week
Plan is to do some more research and to start working on the spec for the backend.
A goal would be to come up with a basic algorithm that is somewhat effective in predicting win/loss and also to have a spec done within a week or two.
