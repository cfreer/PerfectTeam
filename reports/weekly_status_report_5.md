#### Progress and Issues
I did a lot of work on the backend this week. We reformatted the backend to fully be in the API, so I added the player and team routes. I also updated the testing documentation and added API testing. One issue was when changes were made to the database, it would break the API, but adding the API tests has helped with this issue, and we will likely not be making a lot more changes to the database.

#### Plans and Goals
- Get suggested players for teams working in the backend.
- Add tests for this feature.
- Help the team complete HW7.
