## Team Report
### Goals From Last Week
- Finalize suggested players feature (Caroline)
- Add extra interactions to the create team page to improve user experience (Amanda)
- Change and clean data in database (Juan)
- Start looking into using ML for our backend algorithm (Ned, Amanda)
- Continue improving UI for games, teams, and player pages (Aaron)

### Progress and Issues
We improved the backend this week to have an endpoint for getting players' stats by name and functionality for the suggested players feature. We also fixed the typos in the player database and added URLs to their profile pictures, so we can have images.

### Plans and Goals

- Add support for player profile pictures in the frontend (Aaron & Amanda)

### 3. Caroline
#### Goals From Last Week
- Get suggested players for teams working in the backend.
- Add tests for this feature.
- Help the team complete HW7.

#### Progress and Issues
This week I added an endpoint to the backend API to get players' stats by name. I also added to the quick add endpoint to allow the user to optionally supply 3 players' ranks to make sure they are included in the team, which will be used for the suggested players feature. I also added tests for both of these new functionalities. No major issues this week, which is good.

#### Plans and Goals
- Help the team complete HW8.
- Help frontend where they need and adjust backend to meet their needs.
