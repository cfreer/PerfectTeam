### 5. Ned
#### Goals From Last Week
A plan that I have to increase accuracy in my algorithm was to take into consideration age as a factor in determining how well a player is going to play the next season but more importantly the players projected stats for the next season. I have seen similar patterns in how players will hit a prime and the deteriorate. Most players don't improve past their 27th and 28th birthdays. Another factor I need to implement is how much playing time makes an influence on the game. While one player may not get a lot of time on one team, they may get a lot more attention on another which can change how winshares and other stats are calculated.

My goal is to find a way to implement these biases into my algorithm and finalize what I need from the other classes to do what I want to do.
