## How to Use the Software
To create a customized team, navigate to the Create Team page using the “Create Team” tab on the navigation bar or the “Create a Team!” button at the bottom of the home page. Once you are on the Create Team page, type in an NBA player name into the search bar located under the navigation bar. Player name search suggestions will appear under the search bar as you type. Click on the orange “Add Player” button to confirm adding the player you have entered into the search bar. The player’s name and profile picture will appear in the “Current Team” list in the lower half of the page. Please enter 12 NBA players individually into the search bar and add them to the current team. You may also use the “Quick Add NBA Team” button to easily add 12 players from an existing NBA team. Once you click on the button, a popup box will appear on the screen with a dropdown menu. Please use the dropdown menu to select the NBA team you would like the 12 players to be added from. After the current team contains 12 players, a “Create Team!” button and a "Clear Team" button will appear at the bottom of the “Current Team” name list. Click on the "Create Team!" button to get the win prediction and luxury tax amounts in the top-right statistics box. Use the "Clear Team" button to remove all players in the current team. You may also use the "X" button next to a player's name to remove that one player from the team.

The Create Team page loads with the current NBA salary cap set. If you would like to set your own salary cap, click on the edit button next to the salary cap shown in the top-right statistics box. A popup box will appear on the screen, and you may input the new value you would like to set the salary cap. Use the “Save” button to set the salary cap to your entered value.

Receiving player suggestions are currently works in progress.

The Teams page is essentially the simplest page on the web application. You can go to the Teams page from the navigation bar. You will then see a table containing the current NBA teams, their location in the world, and their current season record. This page is purely informational for users unfamiliar with the NBA and would require some additional information to get started and eventually feel comfortable with the app.

The Games page is a little bit more complicated than the Teams page. Again, this page can be accessed by clicking “Games” from the navigation bar. This page is meant to be informational for the user, as it will contain the upcoming games in the NBA, their location, and start time. This page will update along with the current schedule of the games and be an effective tool for users who are curious about the predicted outcomes of upcoming games. This feature is very effective with the “Quick Add NBA Team” feature on the Create Team page, and we recommend users take advantage of this when they wish to see the predictions for upcoming games.

The Players page is the major information hub on the specifics of each player. This page can be accessed from the navigation bar by clicking on the “Players” tab. You will have access to a search bar to search for current players in the NBA. Upon clicking on the “Search Player” button to look for a player, you will see the appropriate matching player’s icon pulled up below the search bar (work in progress). The player’s current team, age, salary, and predicted win/shares will be shown. This page provides valuable information about players. If you would like to search for another player, simply click on the “X” icon in the search bar and input the name of another player.

We are currently working on adding more game-average statistics in the future to give users an even better concept of the players.
